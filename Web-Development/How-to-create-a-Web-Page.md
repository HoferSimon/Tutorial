# How to create a Web Page?

> In this part of the Web Development tutorial, we will learn how to create a Web Page.

> To start with, we will need to create a new file. With the following name: "index.html" and save it in the same folder as the other files in this tutorial. You will notice that the file will get an icon with your primary browser. This is because the file ends with ".html". This is the file type that will be used to open the file in your browser. You can try to open it in your browser and see what happens. Exactly...Nothing, the file is empty.

> To change that, you can open the file with your favorite text editor. You can use any text editor that you like. You can use Notepad, Sublime Text, Atom, VS Code, or any other text editor.

> Congratulations, you have created your first Web Page. To continue with the tutorial, you can go to the next section [HTML Tutorial](/Web-Development/HTML/html.md).
